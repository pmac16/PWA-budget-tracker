# PWA Budget Tracker 

## User Story

```
AS AN avid traveler
I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling
```

## Description

When starting this applicaton, the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database.
Through this application, a user is able to input a deposit or withdrawal transaction. These transactions are kept in a running list at the top of the page. On the bottom of the page is a graph that shows the flow of money. 
Users are able to complete these transactions even without a data connection. After their network connection is restored, they are alerted that their transactions have been submitted.
